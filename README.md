# Final Project: Finch Robot Challenges 
By: Keren Chavarria, Evan Morrison, and Layla Taylor

## Essential Question
How can we apply object-oriented programming principles and Java concepts to create interactive, autonomous robot behaviors that solve real-world challenges?

## Project Overview
In this project-based learning experience, you will program a Finch 2.0 robot to perform one of three challenges:
1. Choreograph a dance routine (with movement, lights, and sound)
2. Create an artistic drawing using the robot's movements
3. Navigate a maze autonomously

Your program must demonstrate your understanding of Java programming concepts from APCSA and object-oriented design principles while creating an engaging robot behavior.

## Learning Objectives
- Apply Java programming concepts in a physical computing context
- Implement object-oriented design principles
- Develop problem-solving skills through algorithm development
- Create well-documented and maintainable code
- Practice technical communication through presentations and documentation


## Description of design choices
We wanted to do something more creative, so we chose the song "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star." We chose this song because it has repetition, which is easier to execute in the code.

## Challenges faced and solutions
The challenges that we faced include:
    Having to learn the finch api to utilize our code fully
        To resolve this we had the API open on the side to go back and refer to.
    The finch is consistently disconnecting 
        Having someone be on standby with the Finch to reconnect it, and asking Mr. Aiello for help.
    Our chords not sounding like the ones in the song
        To solve this problem, we used different number ranges for specific notes to get the correct tone.
    Reducing redundancy within our code
        Creating more methods that would repeat a specific segment in the song.

## Future enhancements
    In the future, we hope to make our robot draw mini stars as it plays the lullaby. In additon, we hope to incorporate a while loop to reduce redundancy in our code.
